# Event, Sample Space and Probability 

The probability of the occurance of an event, A, is: 

```
	P(A) = # favorable outcomes / total # of ocurrances
```
## Two Fundamental Rules of Probability 
1.  0 <= P(A) <= 1.  
2.  Sample space = S. P(S) = 1 
3.  P(A') = 1 - P(A) 
	* P(A') is the probability of an event not ocurring. 

#### Question 1 

Find the probability of getting an odd number when rolling a 6-sided fair die. 

	* Experiment: rolling a 6-sided die 
	* Sample Space (S): S = {1, 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6}
	* Event (A): that the number rolled is odd (i.e., A = {1, 3, 5})


	* P(A) = # favorable outcomes / total # of ocurrances 
	* P(A) = |A| / |S| 
	* P(A) = 3/6 
	* P(A) = 1/2 


## Compound Events, Mutually Exclusive Events, and Collectively Exhaustive Events 

Consider two events, A and B. A ∪ B denotes the ocurrance of either A or B. A ∩ B denotes the ocurrance of A and B together. 

A and B are said to be _mutually exclusive_ or _disjoint_ if they have no elements in common. The prob of any 2 or more events ocurring is the Union (∪) of events. 
	* P(disjoint events) = Sum of events' individual probabilities 
	* P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) 

A and B are said to be _collectively exhastive_ or a _partition_ if their union covers all events in the sample space.
	* A ∪ B = S and P(A ∪ B) = 1 

If two events, A and B, are independent 
	* The probability of both events is the product of the probabilities of each respective event. 
	* P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)


* |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
